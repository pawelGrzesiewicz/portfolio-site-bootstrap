I love fixing stubborn bugs and experiencing those magical moments of enlightenment when, after hours of debugging, I manage to write that one line that makes the code work \uD83D\uDE09 Currently, I am focusing on developing programming skills in JavaScript and React/Next.js. It's a fascinating environment that gives me the opportunity to create interactive and dynamic web applications. I'm delighted to expand my knowledge and gain experience in the coding world."
